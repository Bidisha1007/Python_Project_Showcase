'''Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:

Mat size must be X. ( is an odd natural number, and  is  times .)
The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.'''
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
n,m = map(int,input().split())
pattern = [('.|.'*(2*i + 1)).center(m, '-') for i in range(n//2)]
print('\n'.join(pattern + ['Thank You'.center(m, '-')] + pattern[::-1]))
